## Using Postman to Request the Server

   - Click on "New" and select "Request".
   - Name your request and choose a collection to save it in, if desired.

4. **Choose the HTTP Method**:
   - Select the appropriate HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the API endpoint you want to test.

5. **Add Headers or Body** (if necessary):
   - If your request requires headers or a body (e.g., for POST requests), add them in the respective tabs.

6. **Send the Request**:
   - Click "Send" to make the request to the server.

7. **View the Response**:
